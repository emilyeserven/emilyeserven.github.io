<p>Before I actually start the hackathon, I wanted to write my expectations and hopes.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-expect">What do I expect?</h2>

<p>I’m expecting a group of people with a heavier skew towards front end and lighter skew on design. There will probably be more people doing more non-web code, and the age will be around…. average 30s? It’ll probably skew to have more men as well (except for the designer population). In terms of experience, I’m expecting people that have some job experience in their field due to the topics of the hackathon.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-want-to-do">What do I want to do?</h2>

<p>Originally, I wanted to use PHP for back end development. However, I don’t think I have enough practical experience coding it yet. Instead, I’ll do what I’m comfortable with (HTML, CSS, and maybe some design input) so I can focus more on the process of participating in a hackathon rather than the technology.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-want-to-do-this">Why do I want to do this?</h2>

<p>I want to know more developers, and I want to have experience coding something original with other people that isn’t for work.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading! I’ll try to write more reflections after each day on the train ride back.</p>
