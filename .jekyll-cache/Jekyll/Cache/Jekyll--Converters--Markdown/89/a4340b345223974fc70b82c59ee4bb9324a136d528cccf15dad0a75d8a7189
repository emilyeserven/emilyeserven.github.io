    <p>Revel Cellars designs custom wine cellars. They originally needed an update to their non-responsive website in 2014. Afterwards, I continued to assist with updating the design and back-end workflow.</p>

        <strong>Product Portfolio</strong><br />Revel develops specialty cabinetry and furniture to help customers show off their wine collections in the best way possible. I designed pages that would show off each of these products while also linking users to other relevant information.
