<h2 id="origin--goals">Origin &amp; Goals</h2>

<p>This project was originally for an in-class assignment. We were provided with bare HTML and were to add CSS styling to it. Most students had this as their first exposure to a larger project involving CSS, and were able to see how flexible CSS is. I personally wanted to explore colors and CSS I donâ€™t typically use, since this project was not client-related.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>This was developed without legacy browsers and mobile styling, since I wanted to just explore the CSS without much limitations.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>Since most of my designs tend to use blue or another â€œcoolâ€ color, I decided to work with yellow and black as the primary colors for this assignment. I also used tilted headers with a typewriter-like font to evoke a more vintage style, despite the sectioning of the website following along with modern trends.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I would have done some more tests with the placement of content relative to the â€œTrack Listingâ€ and â€œPersonnelâ€ headings. The flow of content is inconsistent with the â€œFree Jazzâ€ heading, which has no content wrapping on the side. Additionally, the right side of the table within â€œTrack Listingâ€ is not aligned with the right of the â€œRight Channelâ€ part of the â€œPersonnelâ€ section. It could be argued that the amount of content doesnâ€™t warrant giving the table and channel sections their own full rows, which was my original thinking when setting the current placements.</p>

<h2 id="other-nitpicky-improvements">Other Nitpicky Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The units of measurement should have been relative (<code class="highlighter-rouge">em</code>) instead of just <code class="highlighter-rouge">px</code>.</li>
  <li>The black background of the â€œOrnette Colemanâ€ main header is a different black than the rest of the top section.</li>
  <li>The copyright line at the last section doesnâ€™t have a font specified, and looks out of place from the rest.</li>
  <li>Increase line height for easier readability</li>
  <li>The link in the â€œFree Jazzâ€ section should stand out more obviously as a link, perhaps adding a bold font weight would have improved scanability.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusionâ€¦</h2>

<p>Beginners donâ€™t realize how much of an impact CSS makes on the visual appeal and layout of their websites! By adding 153 lines of CSS, I was able to change a rather mundane page into a more stylistically interesting and easier to read experience.</p>
