<p>I wrote about my entire hackathon experience with daily blog posts. Each post about a specific day was written before about midnight the day it happened, an the post-hackathon recap was posted 2 days after it happened.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an index to help you check the contents of each post in case you were more interested in specific aspects.</p>

<p>(Hint: Pre-Hackathon thru day 2 were about the process, day 3 was about the project, and post-hackathon was about lessons learned overall.)</p>

<h2 id="my-original-posts">My Original Posts</h2>

<p><strong>Pre-Hackathon</strong> - Written before I attended the hackathon, contains first thoughts when I had next to no pre-conceptions about what would happen.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expectations</li>
  <li>What I hope to do</li>
  <li>Why I want to do this</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hackathon Day 1</strong> - This day didnâ€™t consist of any coding, rather a first look at the sponsors and a first look at the other participants.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Criteria for choosing projects</li>
  <li>Other notes (regarding project ideas generated and how people were divided in skill set)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hackathon Day 2</strong> - The day where the most activity happened at the hackathon and people â€˜hackedâ€™ the most. I briefly went over some ideas that were brought up again in the post-hackathon recap here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lessons in handling hackathons</li>
  <li>Lessons in personal skill</li>
  <li>Lessons in the industry</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hackathon Day 3</strong> - This post addresses our project idea itself, what work we did (most of our team work was on the last day), and my reflections on why I think we ended up placing 1st in a category.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Settling on an idea</li>
  <li>Last minute scrambles (yay, technical details)</li>
  <li>Presenting the projects</li>
  <li>Post-win reflections</li>
  <li>Project links</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Post-Hackathon</strong> - Written after I attended the hackathon and had time to process the â€˜big ideasâ€™ that I learned.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personal background</li>
  <li>Hackathons are win-win</li>
  <li>Play with cool toys and learn new things</li>
  <li>Networking and social atmosphere</li>
  <li>Ideas win</li>
  <li>Stick through to the end</li>
  <li>A community event</li>
</ul>
