# What is this?

The portfolio site for Emily Serven! I'm not really important, just another web dev. But I figured it was "to theme" to have my portfolio code public so interested parties may be able to view how I work.

# Current Effort

My code process has recently evolved to involve writing documentation much more frequently and alongside the task. I'm updating my site to reflect this better.

# Next Effort

Separating sections between the audiences that care about web apps, freelance web dev, and freelance photography.
