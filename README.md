# What is this?

The portfolio site for Emily Serven! I'm not really important, just another web dev. But I figured it was "to theme" to have my portfolio code public so interested parties may be able to view how I work.

# Current Effort

(Currently reflected by [this issue](https://github.com/emilyeserven/emilyeserven.github.io/issues/22) but hopefully will soon be identified with separate issues and one main label?)

My code process has recently evolved to involve writing documentation much more frequently and alongside the task. I'm updating my site to reflect this better.

# Next Effort

Separating sections between the audiences that care about web apps, freelance web dev, and freelance photography.
