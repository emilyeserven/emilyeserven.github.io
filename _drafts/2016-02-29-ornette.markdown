## Origin & Goals

Originally for an in-class assignment. Took bare HTML and added CSS styling to it. Most students had this as their first exposure to a larger project involving cSS.

## Functionality & Design

Yellow and black because I wanted to experiment with a color scheme I don't usually use. (I skew heavily towards blue.)

## Improvements to be Made

Should use em and not px, didn't have time to fix it

## In Conclusion...

Beginners don't realize how much of an impact CSS makes on the visual appeal and layout of their websites
