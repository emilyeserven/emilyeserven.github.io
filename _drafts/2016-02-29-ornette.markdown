## Origin & Goals

This project was originally for an in-class assignment. We were provided with bare HTML and were to add CSS styling to it. Most students had this as their first exposure to a larger project involving CSS, and were able to see how flexible CSS is. I personally wanted to explore colors and CSS I don't typically use, since this project was not client-related.

## Development

This was developed without legacy browsers and mobile styling at first, since I wanted to just explore the CSS without much limitations.

## Design

Since most of my designs tend to use blue or another "cool" color, I decided to work with yellow and black for this assignment.

- Yellow and black because I wanted to experiment with a color scheme I don't usually use. (I skew heavily towards blue.)
- Slightly tilted labels because I thought it looked cool

## Improvements to be Made

Should use em and not px, didn't have time to fix it

## In Conclusion...

Beginners don't realize how much of an impact CSS makes on the visual appeal and layout of their websites
