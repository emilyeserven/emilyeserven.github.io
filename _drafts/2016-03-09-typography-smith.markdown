## Origin & Goals

- typography assignment for web development class

"Choose two quotes or song lyrics and create two web pages that display the quotes in different styles."

Picked one serious quote and a more fun quote.

Jaden Smith is known for tweeting very... nonsensical things. This tweet in particularly famous.

## Functionality & Design

Colors are a callback to twitter

Questionmark is a stylistic element

Combination of blackletter font and heavy san serif.

Black and muted white, hilighted word is 'fear', is dark red to show ominous atmosphere.
