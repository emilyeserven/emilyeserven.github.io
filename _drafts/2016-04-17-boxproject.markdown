## Origin & Goals

Originally, this project was made as a class project using [these specifications](https://dmd1070.com/lessons/box-project.html). I decided to use the box for my 'gaming' motherboard because I thought it would present the opportunity to experiment with different design.

## Development

- First site coded from scratch for quite a while
- Fixed headings plus anchor links are a special challenge

### Design

- "Gamer" CPU, so I got to have more fun than with a traditional website
- Kept the red and the heading style

## Improvements to be Made

- Unit sizing

## In Conclusion...

- Fun to experiment with a differnt style of website
- Different techniques are used and you're exposed to more.
