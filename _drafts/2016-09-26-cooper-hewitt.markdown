## What does a "design museum" curate, anyway?

Design is not simply aesthetically pleasing pieces, but also pieces that are useful and solve a problem. The museum had objects that fulfilled both of these ideas. Even abstract pieces were made to fulfill a purpose.

If I had to describe it in a few words, I would call the Cooper Hewitt "a museum full of functional art".

Note the distinction, *functional* art. The Cooper Hewitt


Despite being technically being in the Fine Arts school, I don't like art museums. (The patience to analyze an art piece and move on to the next one for 2-3 hours is not with me. I much prefer something like the Natural History Museum.) However, the Cooper Hewitt allows for

* There were pieces that were aesthetic, and pieces that were functional. But all of them served a purpose.
* Normal art museums I avoid, since I feel it's more abstract than I would prefer to see.
* The pen added a whole dimension to the experience, being able to view the collection post-visit is a hugely cool feature
* The API makes my developer self very happy

* One floor was closed as they prepared an exhibit

## My Expectations

What I saw was different from my expectations, since I come from a graphic design and digital design background.
