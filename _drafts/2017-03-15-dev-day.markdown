## Purpose and Intention

* Similar to a hackathon, but with less time and more structure + pre-planning

* **Interdisciplinary**: UConn DMD has many fields, gives us an opportunity to specialize
* **Work With Friends**: the experience of making something with other people is a great one
* **Opportunity to Collaborate**: Learn collaboration using Git (to some extent)
* **Portfolio Building**: Some people don't have portfolios or just need more experience

### Isolated and Contained

* One day only!
* Gives everyone an idea of scope

## Planning & Setup

### Project Theme

* Have done an agency parody previously, was functional
* Specific scope and lends itself to more creative uses (ie adding in 3D)


### The Management Side

* Developed a "map" of who does what, when, and how collaboration is done
* Took into account all the skills that would be used and involved
* Will ideals be stuck to? hah
* Need to develop loose timeline
