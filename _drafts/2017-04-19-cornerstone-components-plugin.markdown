This project reminded me of my early days writing code. I would go to various websites, copy some code, and then modify it to my needs. After transitioning to working with WordPress, however, I had less time where I was working with the code directly.

While making a website for a client, I was faced with the need to create an item with a specific look and feel. However, this could only be achieved through HTML coding. Asking the client to work with HTML was not an option, so I decided to look into creating custom elements for the builder. Luckily, the [documentation was very clear](https://community.theme.co/kb/cornerstone-custom-elements/) and even included a completed sample plugin. Another thing that helped with this project was a larger knowledge of programming principles. I was working on completing the CodeSchool JavaScript course and had some knowledge of PHP as well, so I was more familiar with the concepts referenced in the documentation.

This project was built for the [X Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/x-the-theme/5871901) and [Cornerstone](https://theme.co/cornerstone/).
