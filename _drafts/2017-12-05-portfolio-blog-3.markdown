## Introduction

Originally, this whole redesign was done to satisfy requirements for a professional development class I was taking. I didn't intend to change as much as I did, but rather make some minor adjustments. However, I didn't account for the fact that there were two major things have changed since I last redesigned my portfolio. First, my main focus has changed from attempting to acquire commercial work to getting a full-time job. Second, photography has grown from something I was dabbling in to a real hobby. I needed an aesthetic that would better show off my modern and professional design sense and a system to naturally integrate my photography.

## Design

In my last redesign, I had expressed the desire to keep a portfolio design that would give visitors an accurate representation of my design style. This design attitude is something I kept going into this redesign while adding another element: increased professionalism and a more modern design. This caused the aesthetic to slide closer to minimalism than previous portfolio iterations, which worked well in framing the content. 

Initially when starting this rebranding, I wanted to keep the handdrawn aesthetic that had existed since I first got a portfolio. Once I applied a minimalist aesthetic to the rest of the website, it didn't make sense to keep the handdrawn styled typography, so I decided to switch fonts. I avoided google fonts because I think many are starting to look overused, and I wanted something distinct to my brand. Having bought some font packs from DesignCuts, I decided to use fonts from those packs and built a grid of options. 

Since the new design abandoned the handdrawn theme of my previous iterations of branding, I was also able to match my resume and business cards with my website more closely. I also used the image of the Fulton Center ceiling throughout all materials to have a common design thread (that was not a headshot or specific project photo).

## Refocusing Content

Most content-related design decisions were made with my decision to focus on 'showing the full picture' instead of just displaying commercial work. This allowed me to show important side projects and experiments more prominently as well as display my photography, which would have been more out of place in previous layouts.

### Homepage

The homepage was redesigned by taking project features out and replacing them with a link to my work page statements about my design and development style.

* instead of featuring work first and foremost, I concentrated on adding a statement to describe what I care about in my work
* content on the Home page replaced the need for an About page

### Displaying Work

* one of the challenges of the Work page was having a way to go and show all kinds of work (commercial but also side projects and experiments)
* photography was difficult because it wasn't a web-based thing (and I dislike lots of ways photography is displayed, ie large slideshows) and many lightbox implementations don't feel like they truly flow or fit with the website

## Development Notes

* took advantage of flexbox
* CSS transitions (subtle)
* layout edits were done on existing codebase

## Improvements to be Made

* flow between work and blog posts is weird
* bootstrap
