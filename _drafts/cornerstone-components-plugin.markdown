This project reminded me of my early days writing code. I would go to various websites, copy some code, and then modify it to my needs. After transitioning to working with WordPress, however, I had less time where I was working with the code directly.

While making a website for a client, I was faced with the need to create an item with a specific look and feel. However, this could only be achieved through HTML coding. Asking the client to work with HTML was not an option, so I decided to look into creating custom elements for the builder. Luckily, the [documentation was very clear](https://community.theme.co/kb/cornerstone-custom-elements/) and even included a completed sample plugin. Another thing that helped with this project was a larger knowledge of programming principles. I was working on completing the CodeSchool JavaScript course and had some knowledge of PHP as well, so I was more familiar with the concepts referenced in the documentation.

## The Overall Plugin

<img src="../../../../assets/images/blog/cornerstone-icons-full.png" alt="The custom elements integrated with the rest of the built-in items." style="max-width:250px;" />

*The custom elements ("Header & Subheader Element" and "Iconbox Element") grouped with the other elements.*

## The Header & Subheader Element

<img src="../../../../assets/images/blog/cornerstone-header-subheader.png" alt="The item with a header and subheader." style="max-width: 500px;" />

*The result of the "Header & Subheader Element".*

<img src="../../../../assets/images/blog/cornerstone-option-sample.png" alt="A sample of the options that Cornerstone generates." style="max-width: 250px;" />

*The items visible on the back end of the website.*

## The IconBox

<img src="../../../../assets/images/blog/cornerstone-iconbox-long.png" alt="The icon box element with longer text." style="max-width: 750px;" />

*An iconbox with larger amounts of text.*

<img src="../../../../assets/images/blog/cornerstone-iconbox-short.png" alt="The icon box element with fitted text." style="max-width: 375px;" />

*An iconbox with less text more fitted to the icon height.*

* Something of a callback to my earlier coding days
* Working with X theme and Cornerstone
* Documentation was really great
* I have more formal knowledge of code in general, plus PHP
* Was able to recycle the starter code to make something
* Balancing scalability and user-friendliness with simplicity
