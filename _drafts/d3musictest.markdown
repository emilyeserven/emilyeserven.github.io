## Origin & Goals

Learning D3.js has been on my general list of things to do for quite a while now, but only recently have I made the push to actually start trying it out.

Since one of the things I like to do when exploring unfamiliar territory is get exposed to existing code, the main goal of these experiments wasn't to make heavy edits from the original examples. Instead, I wanted to try and modify code that existed already 

* listening to classic rock lately and want to make something to help me get familiar with the artists
* Been meaning to go and catalog my music
* why not make it more dynamic?

* piggybacked off of existing code
* modified input data
* relatively simple use of the tech, but i like to see complicated examples when i have some basic familiarity so i know what's possible

* improvements, ref to github list
