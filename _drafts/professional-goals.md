## JavaScript: Fundamentals

One of the great things about working full-time is being able to do what I love without the distraction of classes and a schedule that is not at their beck and call. For now, the largest benefit is being able to put all of my time into re-solidifying my foundations with people who are incredibly supportive.

The thing about having "understand something deeply" as a goal is that it's difficult to measure. So for now, I'm trying to read and take notes for a book recommended to me (JavaScript: The Definitive Guide). Getting through it has taken longer than I would like, but that's what happens when you take notes. I won't consider these notes done and completely taken down until they've been through one round of revisions. I tend to write wordier notes the first time, but the ultimate goal is to have them be what amounts to 'easy enough to understand cliffnotes'. I believe if you can make something concise, then you're much closer to fully understanding it and being able to apply it.

**Goal**: Take concise notes on JavaScript: The Definitive Guide by the end of next week.

## Mandarin

I'd like to take a second here and thank my mother. When I was a little kid, I'd often ask her how to say various words and phrases in Mandarin. Since I was adopted, my mom didn't know much Mandarin past the basics but still wanted me to grow up with connections to my birthplace. Her solution was to start a program called Chopsticks, which eventully evolved into the Chinese Language School of Connecticut. I stuck with it until the end of middle school, then took Mandarin to fulfill my high school language (and by extension, college) requirement.

Essentially, I already have experience and a foundation with the language. However, I recognize now that I didn't take it as seriously as I should have. In addition to expanding my vocabulary, I want to also correct and relearn concepts that I know are on shaky ground (my tones are really sloppy). To achieve this, I got the beginnings of an online self-paced course that uses an already established textbook and workbook as a base. It aligns with HSK fluency tests, which gives me a clear goal to work towards. While I know passing fluency tests doesn't mean or guarantee actual fluency, I think they're a measure of success that will carry me far enough so that the learning curve between intermediate to advanced will be less intimidating and I'll have less gaps in my knowledge.

**Goal**: Achieve a high score (above 95%) on the HSK 1 exams within the next 9 months.

## Martial Arts

This is sort of a goal without a specific goal. It's good to have those sometimes because it takes the time urgency off of learning and makes you feel more comfortable with taking the time you need for maximum learning quality. 

There's a few reasons why I want to learn a martial art again:

1. I used to take Tae Kwon Do as a kid.
2. I like having practical use cases for what I do, and martial arts will allow me to exercise as well as have ways to defend myself in a worst-case scenario.
3. The specific type I'm looking at starting has origins close to where I was born in China.

I am planning on starting this particular activity in the coming months, and will likely post about it once I'm far enough in.

**Goal**: Learn it, and learn it well.

## The Moral of the Story is...

There's too much to learn and not enough time to learn it all. If I were to expand this list beyond three things to focus on, it would also include things like learning Chinese history, or picking up piano again. Alas, unless a certain degree of focus is applied, nothing will end up actually happening. Plus, there's no one saying I can't go and pick up more hobbies once others have gotten settled.

With Mandarin and martial arts, it seems like significant parts of my childhood are coming back and asking for my attention again. This time, however, I'm going to be doing it all on my own time and with the benefits clearly seen. I'm grateful to my parents for encouraging me to try different things so I already have a springboard to jump off of and learn them now.
