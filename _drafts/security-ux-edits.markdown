PROFESSOR COMMENTS: "Emily, yours is an important topic that the most casual computer-user needs to understand. Unfortunately, this essay doesn't clarify security and user experience, although all the information is in the essay. This essay really needed a short, striking introduction, set off by a page break or at least some white space. The rest of the paragraphs need to be shorter, with less material presented. I think the underlying structure of the essay is fine, it just isn't clear. Nearly every sentence could (or should) be separated into two sentences — some should be three sentences. The blog is going to be really good. The illustrations work well as "subheadings" to separate blocks of text — good idea. And they go with the banner and design. I just really want to get your writing to present what you know in the best possible way."

*This essay was written for a college assignment. Students were to write a commentary on a social issue of their choosing. An 800 word limit was enforced.*

As more people get their own devices and go on the internet, they become increasingly reliant on the services it provides. Proportionally, security and user experience become more important, and better implementation of each becomes more common. Sadly though, it would seem that user experience and security are more often than not at odds with each other. This results in what feels like a zero sum game that is nothing more than an eternal tug of war. Typically implemented security is about presenting barriers to a user. Meanwhile ,typically implemented user experience design is about removing barriers to a user. To truly understand this complex relationship, we need to examine each more closely.



The best security, simply put, is a system that can guarantee the information it’s guarding allows access only to those that have permissions to view it. Security has always been important, but the need for it increases as more people and corporations add increasingly personal and unchangeable information to trusted services. But if it’s so important and pervasive, why does it feel like there's new hack every other week? Inherent dangers of brand new software releases and social engineering aside, the biggest problem is knowing how much security to implement. At what point is a system’s security “good enough” to stop investing in? A tangible valuation and point of diminishing returns is difficult to determine when a business invests in security as well.

Unlike security, user experience design is less known to the average person. After all, the best user experience is the one you don’t have to think about. A good user experience should "empower" the user, allowing them to confidently make choices when using the application. User experience design gets more popular and important as more people use electronics. Before personal computers existed and became commonplace, only people with special training were able to use computers. User experience wasn’t a priority because there would be a user base composed of trained specialists. Especially with the rise of smartphones, laptops, and tablets, the application with the best user experience is the one that wins the common consumer. User experience isn’t a simple thing to design either, as people act unpredictably and have a knack for not using applications the way they were intended to be used in. Because of this, user experience design actually requires multiple phases of user testing combined with knowledge of fundamental principles to optimize.

Oftentimes, security is easy to pick out and annoying to work through. Remember when you had to decipher that near-illegible CAPTCHA challenge or had to wait a certain amount of time in between failed log-in attempts? None of that is any fun, but those actions keep your account secure. Now, do you remember misspelling your email and being told the email you entered doesn’t exist in the database or realizing you had entered an old password after the system explicitly told you so? These experiences make you feel more confident you’ll get the right credentials eventually, and empower you to continue; a great user experience. However, they create security flaws by giving the hackers hints to narrow down your information as well.

<span style="font-size:.85em;">*Thank you, Facebook, I feel safe knowing that a hacker could use this information well too.*</span>

Perhaps the biggest obstacle to security is that people don’t care enough about it to accept stricter authentication requirements. Asking a user to do more tasks besides enter a password and pass two-factor authentication for a single log-in cycle (a cycle to be repeated each time someone decides to log onto an application) is too demanding. This is actually where a good user experience would shine. This experience wouldn’t be giving hints to hackers, but instead would make users feel better throughout the process. This could be accomplished by telling them why what they’re doing is more secure (and why that benefits them), adding polish on the looks of the interface, or even by telling them that they’re awesome people. Security and user experience need not be enemies, as with anything, the key to making them work together is compromise.
