* Code is very self-motivated thing
* initially learned WYSIWYG in 4th grade
* 5th grade started HTML and CSS, neopets? Ballpetsnet?
* Repurposed DHTML freely (I seem to have lost that ability to just test code so freely)
* 6th grade started Kaerumusic, raw HTML
* say around 8th grade I picked up wordpress.com
* eventually picked up wordpress.org

* Now I have the context to realize I really don't Understand these things as deeply as I could

* learn some fundamentals
* do a few guided projects
    * very safe, explains things and gives you something to do
    * learn limits of the tech
    * don't start with codecademy
    * do a few so you learn different syntax styles
* retype Everything
* if you feel inspired to modify and remix something, Do It.
* do a mix of practical projects and experimental projects. experimental can lead to more innovative solutions and fluency in practical projects.
* If you don't take notes you won't remember

* CodeSchool
    * Videos are actually really great, forces you to keep up
* Udacity
    * Quizzes
