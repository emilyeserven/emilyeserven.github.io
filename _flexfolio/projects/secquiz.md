## Original Concept

### Technology & Our Society

* Technology has found itself in every aspect of life
* Work, play, family, everything has been affected both positively and negatively
* at this point, things won't stop progressing
* I believe we need to take actioable steps to protect ourselves and think critically of how we operate in this digital culture

### Why Should You Care?

* Being one in a crowd of billions is abstract
* "Why would someone care about me out of everyone else?"
* They don't, they can automate all that
* You can get incited to do something, echo chambers can be created, you can be incentivized to buy things, etc.

### Awareness is Powerful

* knowing is half the battle
* it's hard to get convinced when you know someone is trying
* give yourself the tools to choose

## Scope and Focus

* one person project
* unfamiliarity with the framework

### The Value of Actionable Steps

* small things that can create huge change

## Visual Theme

* cyberpunk theme is perfect for this
* thinking critically about digital culture

## UX Choices

* only 10 questions, keep accessible

## Development Choices

* no database, no routing

## How to go further?

* Conditional questions
* "In-depth" option
* More animations
* More robust Results
* Connections tied to results
