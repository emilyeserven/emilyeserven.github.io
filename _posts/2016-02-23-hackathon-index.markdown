**Index** - [Pre-Hackathon](../../../../hackathon/2016/02/18/hackathon-day-0.html) - [Day 1](../../../../hackathon/2016/02/19/hackathon-day-1.html) - [Day 2](../../../../hackathon/2016/02/20/hackathon-day-2.html) - [Day 3](../../../../hackathon/2016/02/21/hackathon-day-3.html) - [Post-Hackathon](../../../../hackathon/2016/02/23/hackathon-post.html)

I wrote about my entire hackathon experience with daily blog posts. Each post about a specific day was written before about midnight the day it happened, an the post-hackathon recap was posted 2 days after it happened.

Here’s an index to help you check the contents of each post in case you were more interested in specific aspects.

(Hint: Pre-Hackathon thru day 2 were about the process, day 3 was about the project, and post-hackathon was about lessons learned overall.)

## My Original Posts

**Pre-Hackathon** - Written before I attended the hackathon, contains first thoughts when I had next to no pre-conceptions about what would happen.

* Expectations
* What I hope to do
* Why I want to do this

**Hackathon Day 1** - This day didn’t consist of any coding, rather a first look at the sponsors and a first look at the other participants.

* Criteria for choosing projects
* Other notes (regarding project ideas generated and how people were divided in skill set)

**Hackathon Day 2** - The day where the most activity happened at the hackathon and people ‘hacked’ the most. I briefly went over some ideas that were brought up again in the post-hackathon recap here.

* Lessons in handling hackathons
* Lessons in personal skill
* Lessons in the industry

**Hackathon Day 3** - This post addresses our project idea itself, what work we did (most of our team work was on the last day), and my reflections on why I think we ended up placing 1st in a category.

* Settling on an idea
* Last minute scrambles (yay, technical details)
* Presenting the projects
* Post-win reflections
* Project links

**Post-Hackathon** - Written after I attended the hackathon and had time to process the ‘big ideas’ that I learned.

* Personal background
* Hackathons are win-win
* Play with cool toys and learn new things
* Networking and social atmosphere
* Ideas win
* Stick through to the end
* A community event
